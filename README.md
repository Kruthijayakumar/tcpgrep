# tcpgrep
 We developed  a command line tool called Tcpgrep that can be used to filter TCP traffic using c language. It can be used to filter traffic based on a variety of criteria, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Tcpgrep can also be used to filter traffic based on the contents of the packets.
